# Data Streaming

Keep databases in sync or trigger worklows with our options for data streaming. 

## Trigger Actions

Configure a Trigger Action through the dashboard to stream a database table's change events to a webhook. The webhook used is
is designed to come from an existing Webhook node in Composer.

## Change Data Capture

We have integrated Debezium into our tech stack as a way to give a versatile option for data streaming. Debezium is built on top of Apache Kafka, 
so you can recieve change events from any application that can import a library for Kafka consumers. Debezium easily connects to multiple 
types of databases.
