# Worldsbase
 
Worldsbase is an API for interacting with a game's database and seamlessly integrating with the blockchain.

The backend architecture provides three key functionalities: User management, web3 integration, and database interaction.

Clients connect to Worldsbase via a REST API. There are multiple SDKs and plugins allowing game engines to connect.

## User Management

User ids, connected socials, connected wallets, and more are accessible via the Worldsbase user management API. Provisioned wallets can also be generated via the key management service.

## Database Integration

Read, write, or listen to the database via the Database Integration API. Composer allows no-code workflow automation to be configured and triggered off change data capture in the database.

## Web3 Capabilities

Call integrated smart contracts functions, such as mint/transfer/burn tokens and more. The key management service will automatically sign transactions on the user's behalf (for provisioned wallets). All of this is integrated into a custom L2 rollup with a block explorer. The event listener allows syncing of smart contract events with web2 data.
