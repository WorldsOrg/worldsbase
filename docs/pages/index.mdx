# Worlds Gaming Services (WGS) Introduction
 
WGS is here to help game developers by providing tools that work for them. You can use your own database, personalize your schemas, 
integrate third party software, and seamlessly interact with the blockchain. 

We can talk about problems we have heard with devs using Playfab/Accelbyte and how we are different from them here?
For example:
We have talked to game developers that have used Playfab and Accelbyte and their experience has told us that there is a need for a simpler
game developement tool kit. Why should you be locked in to someone else's schemas or database? There is a need for no-code automation 
tools so that non-developers can contribute. We noticed teams have friction when teams when integrating thirdparty software into these products. 
There are no easy web3 integrations.
