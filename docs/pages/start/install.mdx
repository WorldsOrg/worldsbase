# Installation Guide for Local Development

This guide will help you set up your development environment to work on the project. Please follow the steps below to ensure a smooth setup process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- Node.js and yarn

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository and navigating to the root folder of the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manifest-Git/wgs-mono.git
cd wgs-mono
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies for the project by running the following command:

```bash
yarn run install:all
```

This command installs dependencies for both the server and the client components of the project.

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

You will need to create .env files for both the server and the client. These files will store sensitive information and configurations.

### Server Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the server folder and populate it with the following keys. Replace the placeholder comments with your actual values:

```env
apiPublicKey=YOUR_API_PUBLIC_KEY
apiPrivateKey=YOUR_API_PRIVATE_KEY
organizationId=YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
moesifId=YOUR_MOESIF_ID
SYNDICATE_API_KEY=YOUR_SYNDICATE_API_KEY
X_API_KEY=YOUR_CLIENT_HEADER_KEY
POSTGRES_HOST=YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=YOUR_POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_DATABASE=YOUR_POSTGRES_DATABASE
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

### Client Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the client folder with the following keys:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_X_API_KEY=YOUR_MATCHING_SERVER_X_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=YOUR_COMPOSER_BACKEND_BASE_URL
```

Ensure the NEXT_PUBLIC_X_API_KEY matches the X_API_KEY set in the server's .env.

## Step 4: Initialize Database Tables

Run the following command to create the required database tables:

```bash
yarn run init:tables
```

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

Finally, to start the development server along with the client and documentation, run:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Your setup is now complete! You can begin developing and testing your application locally.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Once the development server is up and running, you can access the dashboard by navigating to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Here, you can sign up or log in to start exploring and using the WGS.
